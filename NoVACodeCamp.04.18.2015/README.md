Building Services with Web API - NoVA Code Camp 2015
====================================================

**PLEASE NOTE** - This is demo code, and may not reflect best practices. 

Specifically, some of the APIs are built with non-conventional folder and/or class names, 
to demonstrate the fact that the conventional folder/file names are not required. You should 
not use the demo apps as an example for how to name your API folders/classes.

Individual project info forthcoming...
