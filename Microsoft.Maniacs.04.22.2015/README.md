Zero to Web in One Meeting - Microsoft Maniacs - April 2015
===========================================================

**PLEASE NOTE** - This is demo code, and may not reflect best practices. 

Some of the projects included (FullFatTemplate and FoldersAndReferences) are simply ASP.NET templates with no code added. The 
HaloGameAPI project is a "from scratch" implementation of a simple Web API and MVC client.

Feedback is welcome, and you can reach me via my blog at http://devhammer.net/contact.
